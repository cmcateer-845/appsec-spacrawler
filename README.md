# appsec-spacrawler

# Overview
A simple web crawler, capable of crawling SPA sites using Puppeteer (Node.JS) and PuppeteerSharp (C#) - simply pass a url to start from, and watch it crawl.

# Getting started
You can either download the latest release, or build from source using Visual Studio 2019 installed with .NET Core 3.1.

The compiled exe can be run as follows: ```SpaCrawler.exe [options]```

# Configuration options
The following command line options may be passed:

* ```--seedUrl <url>```:                  [required] The url to start the crawl from.
* ```--depth <depth>```:                  [required] The maximum crawl depth relative to the seed url.
* ```--screenShots```:                    [optional] Take a screenshot at each page visted during the crawl.
* ```--dumpDom```:                        [optional] Dump the rendered DOM html to a file for each page visited during the crawl.
* ```--headless```:                       [optional] Use a headless browser for the crawl.
* ```--help```:                           [optional] Displays the help page.

# Results
Results are written to a directory called "results", one level up from the program entry point.

Following a successful crawl, the results folder will contain a Summary.txt file, which specifies a summary of the results including the number of crawled links and a list of each link crawled. 

Each crawled link has a unique id associated with it. The Summary.txt file helps to map a crawled link with its id.

For each crawled page, the results folder will also be populated with a png screenshot and a html file containing the rendered DOM html (if ```--screenShots``` and ```--dumpDom``` have been specfied as a command line switches respectivley). These files are identified by thei unique link id, which can be refernced in the Summary.txt file.

PuppeteerSharp is a .NET port of the official Node.JS Puppeteer API written by [Dar√≠o Kondratiuk](https://github.com/kblok).
